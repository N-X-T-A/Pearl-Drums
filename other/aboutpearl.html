            <h2>ABOUT PEARL</h2>
            <p class="p-aboutpearl">
                Pearl started in 1946, founded by Katsumi Yanagisawa in Sumida-ku Tokyo.Katsumi produced music stands
                for the local Japanese market, and as his reputation for quality and craftsmanship grew, he was soon
                urged to supply drums. Searching for a name synonymous with lasting value and prestige, Katsumi chose to
                name his company Pearl. From these humble beginnings, Pearl has grown to become the iconic global leader
                it is today. Pearl products have been loved and played by millions of musicians in every genre of music
                imaginable. From beginner to working professional to some of the most recognizable recording artists and
                live performers the world over, now seven decades later, Pearl instruments continue to remain faithful
                to Katsumi's original vision of value and prestige.

                In 1968, Pearl expanded production beyond percussion instruments and opened a handcrafted flute
                manufacturing facility at its headquarters in Chiba, Japan. Pearl now has two locations for flute
                manufacturing, and Pearl Flutes has grown worldwide to become highly praised by beginners, educators,
                and professional players for their beautiful tone and exacting craftsmanship.

                Pearl employs over 650 globally, including employees in Japan, the United States, Europe, Taiwan, and
                China. Pearl listens, and as a "Total Percussion" brand, we create instruments to meet many musical
                needs, including drum sets, marching and concert percussion, Latin and World percussion, electronic
                percussion, and many others.

                We care for every musician's needs and deliver unrivaled instruments developed from innovative research
                and development combined with world-class craftsmanship to meet those needs.
